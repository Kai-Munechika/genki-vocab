# Genki Vocab

This is a simple and easy-to-browse "database" for all of the Vocabulary and Kanji included in *Genki I* and *Genki II*, the beginning Japanese language learning textbooks.
Every word or kanji character contains a link to [jisho.org](http://jisho.org/) so it's easy to find more info if needed.
Furthermore, global filtering by lesson number is available if you wish to study a particular lesson or set of lessons.
